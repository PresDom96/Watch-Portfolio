This was my first project I made with BootStrap 5 with added CSS and JS
I wanted to make a more funtioning and interactive webpage. This webpage includes interactive buttons, dynamic navigation bar, and  a functioning clock that was coded with JavaScript. I also tried to switch up the colors instead of using the same looking BootStrap colors that are common. This was also my first time trying out adding and aligning pictures to a webpage. I think it turned out well as they are also dynamic and change with the screen size.
